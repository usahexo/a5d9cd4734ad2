#  Bovada basketball tips: how to beat the bookies and win big

Almost everyone who enjoys a spot of sports betting will have had a dabble with basketball at some point. After all, the sport is immensely popular all over the world, and there are plenty of juicy bets to be had on both the professional and collegiate levels.

Whilst basketball is considered one of the easier sports to bet on, it can still be difficult to turn a profit in the long run. In this article, we'll take a look at some bovada basketball tips that should help you to beat the bookies and take home some serious winnings.

1. Study the form

One of the most important things to do when betting on any sport is to study the form closely. This is especially true in basketball, where teams can often go through hot and cold streaks. Make sure you know which teams are in good form and which ones are struggling, and then make your bets accordingly.

2. Look for value bets

Another key thing to remember when betting on basketball is that not all bets are created equal. Just because a team is heavily favoured to win doesn't mean they're a shoo-in - in fact, there's often great value to be found in betting against the odds. Instead of simply backing the favourite every time, try looking for good value bets elsewhere on the board.

3. Don't over-bet

This may seem like common sense, but it's important to remember not to bet too much money on any given game - especially if you're new to sports betting altogether. Start out by betting small amounts until you get a feel for how things work; gradually increasing your stakes as you become more comfortable with the process. This will help you to avoid losing too much money in case things don't go your way.

Few people would associate the small German city of Oldenburg with professional basketball. However, the BasketOldenburg club has been making a name for itself in recent years as a top-tier sports betting proposition.

The secret to the club’s success is simple – rigorous research and a bit of luck. The team’s analysts pore over match data and betting odds to identify promising matchups. They then place their bets accordingly, taking into account injuries, form and other factors.

While there is no guarantee of success, BasketOldenburg has enjoyed some impressive wins in recent years. In 2016, for example, the club netted profits of €165,000 from sports betting alone. Not bad for a team from a small city in northern Germany!

Looking to make some extra money on the side? Why not look into basketball betting? In this article, we will take a look at BasketOldenburg's top tips for success when it comes to betting on basketball games.



1. Do your research

One of the most important things when it comes to betting on basketball is to do your research. This means looking into the form of both teams involved in the game, recent results, injuries and other factors that could affect the outcome. By taking all of this information into account, you will be in a better position to make an informed decision on who to back in the game.


2. Look for value

Another key factor to consider when betting on basketball is to look for value. This means finding odds that offer good value for your money, rather than simply going with the favourite every time. There may be occasions where the underdog offers good value and can be backed at a higher odds, so it is worth keeping an eye out for these bets.


3. Use multiple sportsbooks

When betting on basketball, it is always a good idea to use multiple sportsbooks. This will give you a greater range of betting options and allows you to find the best odds available on each game. It is also worth checking out each sportsbook's bonuses and promotions, as this can help increase your profits further.


4. Stay disciplined

It is important to remember that gambling should always be seen as entertainment and should not be used as a way to make money permanently. This means staying disciplined when betting on basketball and only wagering what you can afford to lose. If you stick to these guidelines, you are far more likely to enjoy success over the long term when betting on basketball games.

#  5 strategies to help you win at betting on basketball

1. Do your research

The first step to winning at betting on basketball is doing your research. This means studying the teams and players involved in each matchup, as well as looking at past results and trends. There are a number of online resources that can help you with this, such as sports websites and betting forums.

2. Keep a record of your bets

A good way to improve your chances of winning at betting on basketball is to keep a record of your bets. This will help you track how successful you are and identify any patterns or trends. It will also allow you to make better decisions in the future, based on your past successes and failures.

3. Spread your risk

One of the key things to remember when betting on basketball is to spread your risk. This means not putting all your eggs in one basket by betting on just one game or team. By spreading your risk, you’ll minimise your losses if things don’t go according to plan.

4. Use multiple betting options

When betting on basketball, it’s also important to use multiple betting options. This will give you more chances to win and increase your profits if you do happen to win. Some of the most popular types of bets when it comes to basketball include head-to-head matchups, over/under bets and point spreads.

5. Manage your bankroll wisely

Finally, one of the most important things to remember when betting on basketball is to manage your bankroll wisely. This means never gambling more than you can afford to lose and always having a backup plan in place in case things don’t go according to plan.

#  BasketOldenburg: How to turn a profit from sports betting

This guide is for people who want to make a profit from sports betting, but don’t know where to start. Here, we will outline some of the basics, including how to find value in your bets, how to analyse games, and how to manage your bankroll.

## Finding value in your bets

One of the most important things to remember when betting on sports is that you need to find value in your bets. This means that you need to make sure that the odds you are getting offer you a good chance of winning money in the long run. To do this, you need to compare the odds available at different bookmakers and choose the ones that offer the best value.

For example, let’s say that you think Manchester United are going to beat Liverpool by three goals. The odds at one bookmaker might be 4/1, while at another they might be 11/2. In this case, it would be worth betting on Manchester United at the second bookmaker, as they offer much better odds.

It’s also important to remember that not all bets are created equal. Some bets (such as match winners) are much easier to win than others (such as correct scores). As a result, it’s important to only place bets that offer good value and avoid those that don’t.

## Analysing games

Once you have found some bets with good value, you need to start analysing games in order to work out which ones are most likely to win. This can be done by looking at things such as past results, recent form, and injuries/suspensions. By doing this, you can get a better idea of how each team is likely to perform and place more confident bets.

It’s also important to look at how each team plays against their opponents. For example, if Manchester United are playing Liverpool, you would want to look at how United have performed against teams of a similar calibre. If they have been winning most of their matches by a narrow margin then it might be worth backing them to win but under 2.5 goals instead of outright winning the match.

## Managing your bankroll

Another important thing to remember when betting on sports is that you need to manage your bankroll correctly. This means ensuring that you always have enough money left over should you lose a bet or two. It also means ensuring that you never bet too much money on any one game.


If you follow these guidelines, then you should be able to make a profit from sports betting in the long run.
