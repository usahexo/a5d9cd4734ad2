#  When Did Playing Start in Atlantic City?

The history of casinos in Atlantic City dates back to the late 1800s, when a group of men attempted to create a citywide lottery. The plan was quickly squashed by state lawmakers, but it planted the seed for future gaming developments in the seaside town.

Fast-forward about 50 years and casino gambling was legalized in Atlantic City. The first casino—the Resorts Casino Hotel—opened its doors on May 26, 1978. It was a modest facility with just 130 slot machines and five table games. In the early days, casino patrons had to bewagered at least $2 in order to participate in gaming activities.

Since then, Atlantic City has seen its share of ups and downs when it comes to gambling. The city once held a monopoly on East Coast casino gambling, but that changed in the early 1990s when states like Pennsylvania and Connecticut began legalizing casinos within their borders. In recent years, Atlantic City has experienced a surge in competition from casinos in neighboring states as well as from racinos (racetracks with attached casinos).

Despite this competitive pressure, Atlantic City remains one of the country's most popular destinations for casino gaming. According to statistics from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, more than 33 million people visited Atlantic City's casinos in 2016—a number that has been steadily declining since its peak of 38 million visitors in 2006.

So what is responsible for Atlantic City's enduring popularity? There are likely many factors at play, but some experts suggest that it's the city's proximity to major metropolitan areas like Philadelphia and New York City that gives it an edge over other gaming destinations.
