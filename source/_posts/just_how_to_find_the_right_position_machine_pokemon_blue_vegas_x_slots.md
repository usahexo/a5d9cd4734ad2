# How to Find the Right Slot Machine in Pokemon Blue

If you're playing Pokemon Blue and are on the hunt for a slot machine that will give you the best chance of winning big, you've come to the right place. In this article, we'll go over some tips on how to find the right slot machine in Pokemon Blue.

## Look for the Lucky Machines

One common belief among slot machine players is that certain machines are "lucky" and have a higher payout rate than others. While this may or may not be true, it's still worth looking for machines that seem to be paying out more often than others.

In Pokemon Blue, the slot machines in the Celadon City Game Corner are a popular destination for players. While it's not clear whether certain machines in this area are luckier than others, it's still a good idea to observe which machines are currently being played and which ones are sitting idle.

## Check the Payout Rates

Each slot machine in Pokemon Blue has a different payout rate, which is the percentage of times the machine will payout over the long run. Generally speaking, machines with higher payout rates will give you a better chance of winning over time.

To check the payout rate of a machine in Pokemon Blue, you'll need to interact with the machine itself. Press the A button to bring up the machine's menu, then select "Check Payout Rates" to see the rates for all three reels. If you're not satisfied with the payout rates for a particular machine, move on to another one.

## Stick to Machines with Lower Bets

In Pokemon Blue, the slot machines at the Celadon City Game Corner have three different betting options: 1 coin, 2 coins, and 3 coins. While it may be tempting to go for the 3-coin option in the hopes of winning big, it's actually better to stick to the 1-coin option.

The reason for this is that the payout rates for the 1-coin option are generally higher than the payout rates for the 2-coin and 3-coin options. So while you may win more money if you hit the jackpot on a 3-coin machine, your chances of doing so are lower than they would be on a 1-coin machine.

## Conclusion

By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to finding the right slot machine in Pokemon Blue. Remember to look for machines that seem to be paying out more often, check the payout rates before you play, and stick to machines with lower bets for the best chance of winning big. Good luck!
