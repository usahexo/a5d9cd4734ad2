#  North Carolina Gambling Taxes Rate Set For 2019

The North Carolina gambling tax rate will remain at 35 percent for 2019, the state Department of Revenue announced earlier this week.

Since its legalization in 2007, the Tar Heel State’s gaming tax rate has been one of the highest in the nation. Only Nevada and South Dakota boast a higher levy on gambling revenue, at 36 percent and 37 percent, respectively. neighboring Virginia charges just 20 percent on casino winnings.

This recent news is unlikely to come as a surprise to motorists traveling along I-40 through the western edge of North Carolina. Signs advertising casinos and racetracks are a common sight from mile marker 10 to mile marker 370. In all, there are currently five licensed casinos and three licensed race tracks operating in the state.

According to data from the Department of Revenue, casino gambling generated $168 million in tax revenue in fiscal year 2018. That number is down from a high of $198 million in FY 2016, but is still well above the $137 million generated in FY 2014. The decrease can likely be attributed to the proliferation of new casinos in other states, most notably Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Betting on horse races is also big business in North Carolina. In FY 2018, pari-mutuel wagering generated over $236 million in taxes for the state, more than twice as much as casino gambling.

#  North Carolina Revenue Department Sets Gambling Tax Rate

The North Carolina Department of Revenue announced last week that the state’s gambling tax rate will be set at 34 percent. The new rate, which goes into effect on January 1, 2017, is a slight increase from the current 33 percent tax rate.

The decision to raise the gambling tax rate came after lawmakers failed to pass a proposed bill that would have increased the rate to 35 percent. The bill, which was introduced by Representative Chuck McGrady, would have generated an additional $2 million in revenue for the state.

Department of Revenue officials say that the new tax rate will help generate an additional $17 million in revenue for the state next year. Most of that revenue will come from illegal gambling operations, which are currently not taxed by the state.

 Governor Pat McCrory released a statement applauding the decision to raise the gambling tax rate. “This increase in the gambling tax rate will help us generate much-needed revenue for our schools and other vital public services,” said McCrory.

Revenue from North Carolina’s gambling tax is used to support a variety of important programs, including education, public safety, and infrastructure projects.

#  What Is The Gambling Tax Rate In North Carolina?

The gambling tax rate in North Carolina is taxes on net proceeds from pari-mutuel betting, gambling, pull tabs, and tip jars. This is a flat tax rate of 10%. There are no exemptions for certain forms of gambling or types of businesses.

The gambling tax rate was last changed in 2007 when it was lowered from 15%. The 10% tax rate is lower than the nationwide average of 25%. Several other states have lower gambling tax rates, including Louisiana (5%), Nevada (6.75%), and New Hampshire (0%).

There are two reasons for the relatively low gambling tax rate in North Carolina. The first is that the state government wanted to make it more attractive for businesses to operate gambling establishments in North Carolina. The second reason is that the state government wanted to provide more revenue for education funding.

The revenue generated from the gambling tax has been modest. In fiscal year 2017, the state collected $5.8 million in taxes from gambling establishments. This accounted for less than 0.1% of total state revenue.

#  NC Revenue Department Announces Gambling Tax Rates

The North Carolina Department of Revenue has announced new gambling tax rates for the state. The tax rates are based on the type of gambling activity and the amount of money wagered.

The new tax rates are as follows:

* Slot machines: 3% of the amount wagered
* Table games: 10% of the amount wagered, with a minimum tax of $5 per game
* Lottery tickets: 57% of gross proceeds
* Charitable gaming: 5% of the amount wagered, with a minimum tax of $0.50 per game

The gambling tax rates will apply to all types of gambling activities conducted in North Carolina, except charitable gaming. Gambling activities include casino games, raffles, bingo, and instant lottery tickets.

The Department of Revenue estimates that the new gambling tax rates will generate $147 million in revenue during fiscal year 2018-2019. This is an increase of $17 million over last year's revenue from gambling taxes.

#  North Carolina Gaming Taxes To Remain The Same In 2019

In August of 2018, North Carolina lawmakers stated that they were looking to overhaul the state’s tax laws. They particularly were interested in increasing the taxes placed on video gaming machines. This overhaul was set to take place in 2019, and it would have increased the tax rate on these machines from 35% to 40%. Unfortunately for the state, this increase will not be happening after all.

According to a recent report from WRAL, the North Carolina House of Representatives has decided not to go ahead with the proposed increase. This is likely due to concerns that doing so could hurt businesses and affect jobs in the gaming industry. The state’s Video Gaming Act currently generates over $100 million in revenue each year, so it’s clear that these machines are a big source of income for the government.

It’s unclear at this point if lawmakers will come up with an alternative plan to increase taxes on video gaming machines, or if they will simply leave things as they are. In any case, it looks like North Carolina taxpayers will be paying the same amount in gaming taxes for the foreseeable future.
