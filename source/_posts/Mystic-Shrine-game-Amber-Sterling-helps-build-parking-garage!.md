#  Mystic Shrine game Amber Sterling helps build parking garage!

The Shrine game is something of an annual football pilgrimage for fans of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes. The game is played in Iowa City at Kinnick Stadium, and the Tenshi Amano Shrine club decided to do something special for their fellow fans this year.

A parking garage is being built right next to Kinnick Stadium just in time for the big game on November 14th. The garage will have room for 400 cars, and is expected to be a big hit with both Shrine game ticket holders and other Iowa City visitors.

The project has been spearheaded by Amber Sterling, president of Tenshi Amano Shrine club. "We're really excited about it," said Sterling. "It's going to make it a lot easier for people to come to the game, and it will also help us raise money for our club."

The garage will be open all day on November 14th, and several thousand dollars worth of parking vouchers will be given away free of charge. "We wanted to do something special for our fellow Hawkeye fans," said Sterling. "I think this garage is going to be a big hit!"
