The game involves betting on where a ball will land after being spun around a wheel with 36 (or 37) numbered slots. Players can bet on single numbers, groups of numbers, colors, or even whether the number will be odd or even.

The house edge in roulette ranges from 2.7% to 5.26%, making it less favorable than blackjack or other casino games. However, roulette does offer some excitement that other games don't and is perfect for those who want to play a low-risk game with some potential for big rewards.

The rules may seem daunting at first, but they are actually quite simple: roll two dice and get as close to 7 as possible without going over. There are a variety of bets available in craps, including ones on individual numbers, combinations of numbers, and even whether the next roll will be higher or lower than the last one.

The house edge in craps can be as high as 11%, making it one of the least favorable games available at the casino. However, craps is an extremely social game that can be lots of fun for those who are willing to take a chance on the odds.
